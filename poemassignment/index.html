    <h1>Jabberwocky</h1>

    <h4>by Lewis Carroll</h4>

 

    <p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
        <br>
        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</p>

    <p>All mimsy were the borogoves,
        <br>
        And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

    <p>"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
        <br>
        The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</p>

    <p>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
        <br>
        The frumious Bandersnatch!"</p>


    <p>He took his vorpal sword in hand;
        <br>
        Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”</p>
        
    <p>So rested he by the Tumtum tree
        <br>
        And stood awhile in thought.</p>
